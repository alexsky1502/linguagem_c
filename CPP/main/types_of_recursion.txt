types of recursion

1. tail recursion
2. head recursion
3. tree recursion
4. indirect recursion
5. nested recursion

Tail Recursion: after the call, there is nothing to perform. CAlling it self, and it is the last
statement. When it is returning they do nothing. #Loop is better than recursion in this case.

Head Recursion: there is no statement, no operation before the fuction call. it means the function
doesent have to proccess or perform any operation at the time of calling. it has to do everything 
only at the time of returning. #recursive is better than loop in this case.

Tree Recursion: recursive function that is calling itself more than one time. Time complexity = O(2^n)
Space complexity = O(2^n+1 - 1)
